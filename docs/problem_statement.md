## Problem Statement

Modern enterprises generate large volumes of operational, sales, and customer-related data. 
However, decision-makers often struggle to consolidate this information into a single, 
actionable view that highlights performance gaps, operational inefficiencies, and risk exposure.

The absence of integrated analytics leads to:
- Poor visibility into revenue performance vs targets
- Delayed identification of operational bottlenecks
- Limited understanding of customer and complaint-driven risks
- Reactive decision-making instead of proactive insights

This project addresses these challenges by building an end-to-end Power BI analytics solution 
that integrates sales, operations, targets, and complaints data into a unified performance 
and risk monitoring dashboard.
