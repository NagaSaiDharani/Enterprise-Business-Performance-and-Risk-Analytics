## Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)

All data preparation was performed using Power BI Power Query to simulate 
real-world analyst workflows.

Key cleaning steps included:

- Standardizing column names and data types
- Handling missing values in categorical fields
- Removing duplicate records where applicable
- Creating calculated flags (Is_Delayed, High_Risk_Flag)
- Ensuring consistent date formats across fact tables
- Validating numeric fields such as Revenue, Profit, Refund Amount

No manual Excel or SQL preprocessing was used. 
All transformations are fully reproducible within Power BI.
